Fork of `ironrdp-server` 0.13.0.

## RemoteFX header blocks lost to a buffer retry

`RemoteFxHandler` carries the desktop size as an `Option`, and `Some` is what makes
`RfxEncoder::encode` emit the once-per-connection RFX header blocks (`TS_RFX_SYNC`,
`TS_RFX_CONTEXT`, `TS_RFX_CHANNELS`, `TS_RFX_CODEC_VERSIONS`). Upstream `take()`s that
`Option` *inside* the loop that grows the output buffer on `NotEnoughBytes`, so a first
frame whose encoding overruns the buffer consumes the headers on the attempt that failed
and re-encodes without them. The buffer is sized from the frame's raw BGRA length, and RFX
always emits whole 64x64 tiles, so anything tile-padded — a few-pixel rect, or a thin strip
like a 1px window border — encodes larger than its source and takes that path. The headers
are never re-armed, so every later frame is rejected (FreeRDP: `rfx_process_message:
incomplete header blocks processing`) and the viewer stays black for the life of the
connection while input still works. Which frame arrives first is the target's choice, which
is why this strikes some deployments and not others; see warp-tech/warpgate#2606.

`warpgate.patch` reads the size without consuming it and clears it only once a message
carrying the headers has been built. It also drops a `* 2` from the adjacent buffer-resize
`debug!`, which reported twice the size actually allocated.

## Bitmap scan width in bytes

The legacy bitmap path (clients without Surface Commands, such as Jump Desktop) writes the
Compressed Data Header's `cbScanWidth` as the width in pixels. MS-RDPBCGR words it that
way, but the FreeRDP server sends `width * 4` for 32 bpp and clients read it so: Jump
Desktop drew every bitmap at a quarter of its width and rejected widths whose quarter is
not a multiple of 4 ("bad width - must be divisible by 4"). `src/encoder/bitmap.rs` sends
the row length in bytes.

## Bitmap widths that are not a multiple of 4 pixels

Upstream `BitmapEncoder::encode` refuses a rectangle whose width is not a multiple of 4 pixels
(`Width must be a multiple of 4`), and the error ends the connection. A target desktop of such a
width, as after a viewer resizes or reconnects at a new size, ends the session at its first
frame on the bitmap path.

`warpgate.patch` pads each row to the next multiple of 4 pixels with copies of its last pixel
and declares the padded width, while the destination rectangle keeps the real width, so the
client clips the padding. The scan width above is that of the padded row. xrdp sends its bitmap
updates the same way (`libxrdp_send_bitmap` in `libxrdp/libxrdp.c`).

`Cargo.toml` additionally sets `[lints.rust] warnings = { level = "allow", priority = 1 }`
so this vendored path dependency's warnings don't surface in Warpgate's builds. This is not
in `warpgate.patch` (which is source-only); re-apply it by hand on re-vendor.
